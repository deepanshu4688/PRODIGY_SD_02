# PRODIGY_SD_02
Create a Guessing Game

Objective: Develop a program that generates a random number within a specified range and challenges the user to guess the number. The program should provide feedback for each guess and keep track of the number of attempts until the correct guess is made.

Requirements:

Random Number Generation: The program should generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).

User Input: The program should prompt the user to enter their guess.

Feedback Mechanism: The program should compare the user's guess to the generated number and provide feedback: If the guess is too high, display a message indicating that the guess is too high. If the guess is too low, display a message indicating that the guess is too low. If the guess is correct, display a congratulatory message and the number of attempts taken.

Iteration: The program should continue to prompt the user for guesses until the correct number is guessed.

Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The program should provide clear and concise prompts and messages to guide the user through the game.
Real-Time Feedback: Immediate feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Efficient Looping: Ensure the program efficiently handles multiple guesses and continues until the correct number is guessed.
Accurate Attempt Tracking: Correctly count and display the number of attempts taken by the user.
Implementation Steps:

Import the necessary library for random number generation. Generate a random number within the specified range. Initialize a counter for the number of attempts. Create a loop that: Prompts the user for a guess. Compares the guess to the generated number. Provides feedback (too high, too low, or correct). Increments the attempt counter. Exit the loop and display the total number of attempts when the correct number is guessed.

Tools and Technologies:

Programming Language: Python (or any language you are comfortable with) Libraries: Random library for number generation (in Python)

Expected Outcome: A functional guessing game program that can be executed, providing an interactive and enjoyable experience for the user while meeting the specified requirements. Attempt Counter: The program should count and display the number of attempts made by the user to guess the correct number.
